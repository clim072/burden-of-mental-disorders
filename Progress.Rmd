# Review question

<br>

- To identify COI studies for mental disorders and to explore the distribution of costs between disorders. 

- Included studies will be assessed for methodology, period of study, geographical locations, subgroups and study quality. 

- The results of the review will not be suitable for pooling via meta-analytic techniques, we will explore methods to display the data graphically.

# Data extraction questions

<br>

- Some papers do not report year for the costing (etc. Bell et al). Which assumption should be made?
- Need specific classification of data sources: 1) administrative registers, surveys, national/regional budgets, a mixture?
